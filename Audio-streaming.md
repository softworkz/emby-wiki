The base audio url is /Audio/{Id}/stream. Some players will have better results when the url has an audio file extension, so we also provide several aliases to account for that:

* /Audio/{Id}/stream
* /Audio/{Id}/stream.mp3
* /Audio/{Id}/stream.aac
* /Audio/{Id}/stream.ogg
* /Audio/{Id}/stream.wma
* /Audio/{Id}/stream.flac
