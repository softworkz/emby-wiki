In addition to library items, there are other related items that can be retrieved by name. These are:

* Genre
* Person
* Studio
* Year

These can be retrieved individually on a per-name basis, e.g.

`/Persons/{Name}`

This will return an item with identical structure to normal library items. From there images can be downloaded as necessary. See the built-in documentation for all the related endpoints and parameters.
