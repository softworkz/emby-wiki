After you have developed a plug-in for MediaBrowser, the next step is to get it into the catalog so users can install it.

- First, request a developer id from the MB team by emailing admin AT mediabrowser3 DOT com or posting in the dev forum that you are ready to publish.

- Once you have your credentials you'll need to go to: http://www.mb3admin.com/admin/ and login with the user and password you were provided.

- Then go to the "Packages" area.  This is where you will define your plug-ins (as a user-installed package) and upload versions of them.
