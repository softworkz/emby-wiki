The base video url is /Video/{Id}/stream. Some players will have better results when the url has a video file extension, so we also provide several aliases to account for that:

* /Video/{Id}/stream
* /Video/{Id}/stream.asf
* /Video/{Id}/stream.ogv
* /Video/{Id}/stream.ts
* /Video/{Id}/stream.webm
* /Video/{Id}/stream.wmv
* /Video/{Id}/stream.mp4
* /Video/{Id}/stream.m4v
* /Video/{Id}/stream.mkv
* /Video/{Id}/stream.mpeg
* /Video/{Id}/stream.avi
