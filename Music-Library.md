The recommended folder structure for music is Artist\Album\Song

<pre>\Music
   \Artist Name
      \Album Name
         1- Song.mp3
         2- Song.mp3
</pre>

Any naming convention for audio files is acceptable. Track numbers are retrieved using ID3 tags.

## Music Videos
These are setup using the same conventions as movies. When setting up the media collection, make sure to choose "Music Videos" as the type.

Once setup, you can optionally edit music videos and fill in their artist and album information. If you do, the music videos will appear on the artist's detail page.

## Album soundtrack links
If you edit an album and fill a tmdb id, tvdb id, and/or gamesdb id, we'll be able to link soundtrack albums in your library to their corresponding movie, tv series or game. We'll then display this on the detail page for each item.
