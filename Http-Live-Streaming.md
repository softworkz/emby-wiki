Media Browser supports the Http Live Streaming protocol, also known as HLS.

The url's are:

* /Videos/{Id}/stream.m3u8
* /Audio/{Id}/stream.m3u8

For a complete list or parameters, see the built-in documentation as well as:

[Audio Streaming](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/wiki/Audio-Streaming)

[Video Streaming](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/wiki/Video-Streaming)

Currently we do not support HLS adaptive bitrate streaming, although this is in the backlog for a future release.
