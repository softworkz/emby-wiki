The dashboard is built with **jQuery** and **jQuery mobile**.

It also utilizes [MediaBrowser.ApiClient.Javascript](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.ApiClient.Javascript) for all communication with MB server.

The html code is located within the dashboard-ui folder of the Dashboard project. This is copied to the build output folder, so all html, javascript, css and image files must be marked as "copy if newer".
