Emby Connect is an **optional** service designed to make multi-server connectivity easier. For this reason, we recommend that you first implement multi-server switching in your app via manual address entry, and then later supplement that with Emby Connect.

The best way to manage multi-server connectivity is to always have a server Id in context, from which you can use to retrieve your saved credentials.
