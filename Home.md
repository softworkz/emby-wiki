## API Documentation
Previous releases of Emby included API documentation through the inclusion of [Swagger](http://swagger.io/). Unfortunately, Swagger was removed from Emby around version 3.1.

Luke has [stated](https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/42742-swagger-missing-in-31/#entry398189) that there are plans to restore the API documentation in the future but there is no publicly available timeline for this.

For the time being the best sources for API documentation are the official API client libraries.

* [.NET ApiClient](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.ApiClient)
* [Java ApiClient](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.ApiClient.Java)
* [JavaScript ApiClient](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.ApiClient.Javascript)
* [Swift ApiClient](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.ApiClient.Swift)
