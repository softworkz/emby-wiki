## Api Documentation
The server features built-in documentation [courtesy of Swagger](http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/), allowing you to view methods, parameters and even test them in the browser to see what the responses look like.

## Contributing to Media Browser
We have a growing team but are still looking for more contributors to help us realize a few more goals.

Specifically, we are seeking:

* A developer to assist with the Mono port to help bring MB server to Linux
* A .NET developer to add live-tv support
* Any developer who wishes to use our api for any purpose
* WPF/.NET developers to contribute to Media Browser Theater, whether by means of direct contribution, and/or theme or plugin development.
